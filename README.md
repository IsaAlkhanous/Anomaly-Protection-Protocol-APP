# APP - Classified Archives

## Overview
This project is a website similar to the SCP Foundation, dedicated to documenting and archiving anomalous entities discovered by the APP organization. The website includes detailed pages for each entity, structured similarly to a wiki format.

## Features
- **Entity Pages**: Each entity has its own page, accessible through the main navigation or the dropdown menu.
- **Login_page**: a page to login that currently doesnt check for actual logins
- **Responsive Design**: The website uses a flexbox layout, ensuring compatibility with various screen sizes.
- **Interactive Navigation**: The navigation bar includes a dropdown list of entities, with hover effects that enhance user interaction.
