					There is no concievable way to contain APP-001.<br>
					Without his direction, this world would not have come to be. As such, our universe may come to an end should he wish it so.<br>
					We can only hope that APP-001-1, 001-2, 001-3, and 001-4 can convince him otherwise when such a catastrophic event may occur.<br>
					In the event that APP-001 discovers our work, we hope that he deems us sufficient and be proud of our efforts, as that is the only way for us to survive.

					Does not apply to APP-001. He always existed before us, and he shall persist afterwards should our reality end.<br>
					Only those aware of APP-001 have been employed in the Foundation, and we strive to gain his approval through retrieving other APP entities.

					APP-001, known to all in the foundation as <span id="username"></span>, is a higher-dimensional being that has willed us to existence by commanding APP-001-1, 001-2, 001-3, and 001-4, collectively known as The Writers.
					The Writers are beings that follow APP-001's teachings of reality creation, including matter formation and destruction, presentation of the universe, and physical logic.
					In ██-██-████, The Writers made specific humans aware of abnormalities in their creations, anomalous entities we call APPs.
					The first to recieve this message was █████████ █████████████, the Founder of this institution.
					Everyone that recieves the message states that it was "like a dream" and only know not to refuse the APP Foundation's call to action.
					However, one exception is The Founder, who states that the message was clear: "PREPARE".
					As of ██-██-████, The APP Foundation continues its mission in containing all APPs and recruits all who recieve the message.
				<br>
				<br>
					Should all APPs be contained and no new ones be found, we shall await APP-001's judgement of The Writers' work.
