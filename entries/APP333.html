					APP-33 was retrieved from an underground workshop reported about during renovations of a house in ████████████, Italy.
					Most workers approaching the basement reported either alluring, persuasive speeches to uncover APP-333, or have suffered brain damage and collapsed, comatose.
					After assessing the danger posed, 5 unanimously described "pious "SF Personnel entered alongside a priest from the area to investigate.
					APP-333 was covered with a sheet, and when exposed to sunlight, it introduced itself ecstatingly.
					The priest convinced APP-333 to be kept in containment, and APP-333 agreed without much trouble.

					</figure>
					APP-333 is a sentient, sapient, and autonomous angel statue made during the Renaissance by sculptor ████████████████ █████████.
					It is capable of human-like movement despite its marble makeup, exhibits free thought, and is capable of communication through telepathy.
					It unceasingly proclaims to be an actual biblical angel fallen and stuck in a marble body, and will always intrdouce itself as such.
					If asked about which specific angel it is, or anything related to biblical canon, it responds by claiming to have lost its memories when it fell. Any further questioning leads to it remaining silent.
					APP-333 is very amicable and good natured, and will obey any instructions given as long as it doesn't endanger its body or is antithetical to its behaviour.
					It always offers help to Personnel regardless of Level, in addition to providing useful intel unprompted if it sees fit.
					However, any person it deems a "sinner" will be attacked telepathically on-sight, leading to permanent brain damage or insanity.
					Its criteria for what a sin is is always nebulous, and extreme caution should be practiced when introducing it to new Personnel.
					It currently has a collection of ████ religious texts, and growing.
					<br>
					<br>
					Considering the nature and capabilities of APP-333, Vorsicht designation granted due to possible massacres should it disobey and deem mankind as sinners.
