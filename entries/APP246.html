				APP-246 shall be held in LR-79 in its designated locker, set on a foam pedestal, and always kept upright. This should be maintained with extreme caution monthly.
				Under no circumstance shall a Personnel remove it from its locker without at least 3 Level-&gamma; Personnel's backing and a written approval from a Level-&delta; Personnel.
				Experiments and test using APP-246 should not include the following:
				<ul>
					<li>Use of APP-246 as currency</li>
					<li>Use of APP-246 recreationally as a way to arbitrarily make a decision</li>
					<li>Passing of APP-246 without express intent</li>

		<dt><i>Entity Description:</i></dt>
			<dd>
				APP-246 is a silver sestertius from the Roman Empire, made of brass and 35mm in diameter.
				The "heads" side is a bust of an as-of-yet unknown ruler, while the "tails" side depicts Fortuna, the Roman goddess and personification of luck, surrounded by the words "fortuna, sfortuna" ("Luck, Unluck").
				It was retrieved after the town of <span class='redacted'>---------</span>, Italy was reported to have suffered from unexplainable heart attacks.
				Once the SF Personnel arrived, no one dared to provide further information, fearing Fortuna's wrath.
				Following an investigation, APP-246 was found stuck on a floor tiling, upright. Once removed, it toppled to the "heads" side, and the SF Personnel immediately noticed a hidden treasure beneath the floor tiling.
				She then proceeded to set APP-246 "tails"-side up to investigate, only to fall over dead, caused by a heart attack. The next SF Personnel to approach APP-246 in this state and attempt to pick it up died similarly.
				It was retrieved using a remote flying drone after clearing the area.
			</dd>
			<br>
			<dd>
				APP-246's weight distribution has been analysed to result in a 1 in 2.5 chance of landing on "heads", a 40 per cent chance.
				Due to its anomalous attributes and ease of misuse, it has been designated Vorsicht.

				Initial testing of APP-246 did not enforce the rules set in place as of <span class='redacted'>---------</span>, and as such, was unhinged.
				This was orchestrated by Level-&delta; Personnel Dr.<span class='redacted'>------</span> Farren.
