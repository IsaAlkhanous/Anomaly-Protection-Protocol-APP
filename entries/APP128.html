			<dd>
				APP-128 shall be contained in a Standard Electronic Holding Cell, and always kept on and maintainted every other day.
				In case of power outages, an auxillary generator specifically assigned for APP-128 shall take over, and keep it powered until normal functions are resumed.
				No Personnel should acknowledge APP-128's existence verbally when observing it in its off state.
				Any use of APP-128 or advancement of its form should be coordinated with at least 5 Level-&omicron; Personnel.

			<dd>
				APP-128 is a full-tower computer case standing at 25 inches tall, black in colour, and from an unknown brand. The text "MetaMorpheus" is engraved on its side panel.
				In <span class='redacted'>----------</span> - 2000, a Protocol Upholder on routine patrol noticed APP-128 in a corridor in Site-64, turned off.
				Once the PU called for assistance in identifying APP-128 by describing it verbally to another PU, a metal screeching sound emanated from its position.
				Afterwards, APP-128 had transformed into another, more modern version of itself. This happened a total of 3 times until it was retrieved and placed into its holding cell.
				It is not currently known how APP-128 knows what components fulfill its requirement of advancing to the next form, or from where it procures these components.
			</dd>
			<br>
			<dd>
				Following further experimentation, it was deduced that APP-128 will only metamorphose if its been turned off and actively described.
				Each subsequent form gained new specifications and increased in processing power by a factor of 2.
				Considering its relatively safe maintenance and low threat level, Amin designation has been approved.

		<dt><i>Addendum: Update-Log-128-1</i></dt>
			<dd>
				As of <span class='redacted'>--------</span>, APP-128 has reached peak performance for comparable devices in the technology sector, including ones currently in development.
				Request to allow APP-128 to metamorphose again for research purposes.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<dt><i>Addendum: Update-Log-128-2</i></dt>
			<dd>
				Request Granted; one metamorphosis cycle allowed.

						Metal screeching was louder than usual, and persisted for 60 minutes precisely.
						Additional thumping sounds were heard around the cell, until multiple of Site-64's mainframes were drawn to APP-128 at immense speeds, causing unprecedented prolonged downtime in our systems.
						Once contact was made, APP-128 became entirely unrecognizable and alien. We don't even know how to analyse this, much less describe it.
						Its safe to say it won't evolve anytime soon.
						<br>
						Request to change its Entity Description.
