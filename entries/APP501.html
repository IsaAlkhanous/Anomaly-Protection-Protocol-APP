                    APP-501 is to be housed in a specialized containment chamber constructed of reinforced titanium alloy with motion-sensitive lasers to detect sudden size increases.
                    The chamber must maintain a consistent temperature of 22°C. 
                    Personnel must avoid direct physical proximity (minimum of 5 meters) unless under specific testing conditions and equipped with tranquilizer rifles.
                    Interaction is limited to Level-β Personnel, and food delivery is conducted via automated systems to minimize risk.

                    APP-501 was retrieved from ██████, Mexico, after a series of animal deaths were reported in rural areas. Victims included livestock such as cows, chickens, and sheep, as well as local canines and wolves.
                    The Foundation discovered the entity through witness accounts describing "an adorable but eerie three-eyed cat."
                    During the retrieval operation, APP-501 exhibited its size-manipulation ability, reaching over 3 meters in height. The containment team utilized tranquilizers and netting to subdue the entity before transporting it to Site-███.

                    APP-501 is a feline-like entity with three eyes arranged in a triangular pattern and three tails. It appears harmless, resembling a domestic cat, but displays predatory behavior towards humans and animals. 
                    When threatened, APP-501 increases its body size significantly, reaching up to 5 meters in height, enabling it to overpower its targets.
                    APP-501 lures victims by projecting a calm and innocent demeanor. Once the victim approaches within 3 meters, the entity will pounce with unmatched speed, making escape impossible.
                    Analysis shows that APP-501 does not consume its victims but uses its claws and teeth to incapacitate them. The entity's full motivations remain unclear, though its predatory instincts suggest an anomalous survival mechanism.

                    The following is a log of notable encounters with APP-501 during testing and field operations:

                                During initial retrieval, APP-501 displayed its size-manipulation ability, increasing from 50 cm to over 3 meters in height within 2 seconds. Personnel were forced to tranquilize it after multiple failed capture attempts. No casualties reported.
                            </dd>
                            <dd>
                                Status: Successfully contained.

                            <dd>
                                A controlled test involved introducing a remote-controlled robotic unit into APP-501's chamber. The entity immediately pounced on the unit, increasing its size to 2.5 meters. Upon realizing the unit was non-organic, APP-501 returned to its smaller form and ignored further attempts to provoke it.
                            </dd>
                            <dd>
                                Status: Entity displayed intelligence and preference for organic targets.
                            </dd>

                                Incident during routine cleaning of APP-501's containment chamber. A containment breach occurred when personnel entered without maintaining the minimum distance. APP-501 feigned docility before pouncing on a Level-α janitor. The individual sustained severe injuries but survived.

                                Status: Breach contained. Protocol updated to prohibit personnel entry without tranquilizer coverage.
