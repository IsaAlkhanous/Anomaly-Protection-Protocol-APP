				APP-724 is to be kept in High Security Holding Cell in Site-86. Its room shall be covered with Musou Black paint, and it shall not recieve any light under any circumstance, only observed through infrared vision.
				Should it come into contact with any form of light, a Hades-Level Lockdown of Site-86 shall commence until APP-724 is secured in its cell.
				Shoud if it come into contact with natural sunlight, a Thanatos-Level End-of-Humanity event will be declared and Personnel should follow procedure to prolong the life of any human or anomaly in the vicinity as much as possible.

				APP-724 is a baphomet moth (Creatonotos gangis) of average size.
				It was procured in <span class='redacted'>---------</span>, Japan in a dark apartment filled with similarly caged insects, none of which were anomalous, except the center piece of the collection, now known as APP-724.
				The cage it resided in was covered with a Vantablack cloth with a sticky note attached reading (after translation): "Keep away from light sources".
				SF Personnel responsible for retrieval did not heed the warning and lifted the veil to observe and describe APP-724, allowing his flashlight to reach it.
				Approximately 5 seconds after, a localised low-yield explosion occured within SF Personnel's flashlight akin to a neutron bomb, killing him and severly injuring other SF Personnel in the vicinity.

				After careful retrieval and analysis of what has transpired, it is theorised that any light that reaches APP-724 will have its source explode similarly to a neutron bomb of the same size.
				As such, it has been designated Pericolo, and no experiment or test will be allowed without Level-&Omega; Clearance from at least 10 Level-&omicron; Personnel.
